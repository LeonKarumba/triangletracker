# PROJECT NAME

-Triangle tracker

## AUTHOR NAME

-Leon Karumba

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

-This project known as  triangle tracker determines based on input of base length,height length and hypotenuse length to output an equilateral triangle if all sides are exactly equal or isosceles triangle if exactly two sides are equal and scalene triangle if no sides are equal.In addition the sum of lengths of any sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side.

#### SETUP INSTRUCTIONS 

-clonehttps://github.com/LeonKarumba/triangletracker.git
-create a folder on terminal
-create a file
-go to atom
-edit existing data
-view your website

##### BREAKDOWN OF PROJECT WITH INPUT AND OUTPUT 

-Input valid numbers to base length,width length and hypotenuse length
-If base = width  and width =hypotenuse then output is an equilateral triangle.
-If base=width or width=hypotenuse or length=hypotenuse then output is an isosceles triangle.
-The sum of base + height  is less than or equal to hypotenuse or The sum of base + hypotenuse  is less than or equal to height or The sum of hypotenuse + height  is less than or equal to base then output is not a triangle
